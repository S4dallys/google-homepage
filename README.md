This is my Google Homepage project for theodinproject's course.

I'm glad to have finished at least the html & css part of the foundations course, and I'm glad to say I don't feel like I don't knowor remember anything.

I feel like the foundations course for theodinproject HELPS individuals greatly and give them a foundation to work with. (go throught the additional content on each lesson).

Things I've learned on the way:
* Flexbox
* Grid
* Aligning items and containers horizontally, vertically, baseline-y
* html semantics
* a sort of 'feel' for when to add a div
* the infinite power of stack overflow
* github basics
* virtualbox and the terminal
* browser compatability (ish)
* SEO (ish)
* website reponsiveness using units such as vh, vw, %, flex-grow, etc.
* a LOT of useful websites courtesy of TOP such as csstricks

So yeah! 

Excited for what js has to offer,
